        <li>
            Hardware wallets: Signing was no longer working for Ledger and Digital Bitbox.
        </li>
        <li>
            Memory usage: Wallets now have a configurable limit on how much transaction data they
            will hold in memory, which defaults to 32 MiB.
        </li>
        <li>
            Networking: UI network status was not always updated correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Networking: A long standing rare error when the networking code was looking to switch
            main servers was fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Testing: Python programming language type checking was enabled for more of the code base
            ensuring that there were no bugs due to sloppy programming and bad typing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Translations: Updated the translations from Crowdin, thanks to all people who
            contributed translations.
        </li>
        <li>
            User interface: Many of the user interfaces were doing their own style thing, and now
            use a common base widget and it's style for form layouts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wallet export: This was still attempting to export something that was no longer
            exportable and was erroring.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wallet migration: Failing to import an existing pre-1.3.0 wallet could look like a
            successful migration, at least in the migration UI.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wallet password: Changing the password of an open wallet was broken.
        </li>
