        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Wallet storage: A wallet is now stored in a database, and not a text file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wallet creation: A new wallet wizard streamlines opening or creating wallets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wallet accounts: The groundwork is in place for wallets to have multiple accounts,
                although they can currently only have one. A new account wizard streamlines adding
                new accounts to a wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multi-signature: The multi-signature account creation process has been streamlined
                and polished. New multi-signature accounts send funds in the form of a "bare
                multi-signature" transaction, replacing the now non-functional "P2SH multi-signature"
                transaction that no longer works after the Genesis upgrade to the Bitcoin SV protocol.
            </li>
            <li>
                Notifications: A new notification center and notification display have been added
                to the wallet UI. These will be used to highlight important events and information
                for the wallet owner. Initially only one notification is posted, relating to reminding
                the user to back up their wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Memory usage: Wallets now have a configurable limit on how much transaction data they
                will hold in memory, which defaults to 32 MiB.
            </li>
            <li>
                Translations: Updated the translations from Crowdin, thanks to all people who
                contributed translations.
            </li>
        </ul>
