    The most prominent changes are also summarised below for convenience, if you wish to read more
    about any given change, please read the linked article.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Wallet files: The wallet storage has changed from a JSON file to an SQLite database.
        </li>
        <li>
            Accounts: A wallet can now have multiple accounts, although they are currently limited
            to having only one account until the user interface is reworked to support more than
            that.
        </li>
        <li>
            Multi-signature: The default script type for a new multi-signature account is now
            bare multi-signature. Existing multi-signature accounts can change which script
            type they use for transactions in the wallet preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
            Multi-signature: Support has been added so that multi-signature accounts can opt to
            use the standard form of accumulator multi-signature scripts for transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Networking: Messages larger than 1 MB are now accepted from the server. The limit
            has temporarily been increased to 10 MB, before messages are dropped. This will be
            revisited in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
            Addresses: With the Genesis upgrade payments can easily be made to non-addressable
            payment destinations. This means that it is no longer possible for things that use
            an address to make a payment. BIP276 has been integrated to provide an ability to
            make these non-addressable payment destinations addressable in different way.
        </li>
        <li>
            User interface: There has been a complete rewrite of both wallet and account creation
            user interfaces.
        </li>
    </ul>
