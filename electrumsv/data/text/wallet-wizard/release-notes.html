            The most prominent changes are also summarised below for convenience, if you wish to read more
            about any given change, please read the linked article.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                MacOS: The user interface framework has bugs that only exist on MacOS. We cannot fix these,
                but if your wallet locks up with a drop down modal message box that you can't dismiss, we
                have however provided a way for you to disable drop down message boxes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Local requests: The requests list is now always visible, and works. You can define an incoming
                payment for an address you give out and it will change from unpaid to paid when a payment
                transaction is received and processed.
            </li>
            <li>
                BIP270: ElectrumSV has long had BIP270 support. Now there are merchant services that can
                dispense and process payment requests on behalf of users or businesses, we have fleshed it out,
                hooked it up and tested it thoroughly.
            </li>
            <li>
                The account menu: The menu for an account was accessed by "right clicking" on the account entry
                in the accounts list. Now it can also be accessed by a window-level Account menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transaction dialog: The transaction dialog has been polished a little. It is a little better
                at providing full information, although there is obvious work left to be done on it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Table filtering and refreshing: Filter and refresh buttons have been added to almost all
                tables. This functionality has always been available through hotkeys (Control+R and Control+F)
                but it is very likely that users were not very aware of it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transactions tab: The transactions tab provides a useful aid in keeping track of signed but
                not known to the network transactions. However, it's purpose and contents are non-obvious.
                We now show a summary of how many coins are allocated in signed transactions in the
                transactions tab at the top of the history tab. And a placeholder noting it's purpose when it
                is empty.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unmatured coins: Coinbase coins are not spendable until they have been confirmed many times.
                We were not correctly marking these coins as coinbase, and this meant that it was possible for
                the user or API user to have them accidentally included in a transaction they were making.
            </li>
            <li>
                Account synchronisation: When ElectrumSV connects to the main server it uses, it makes
                subscriptions on that server for all the things it wants to get notified about related
                transactions for. Unfortunately, on disconnection from one server and switching to another
                it would not do the subscription process for the new server and would not respond to blockchain
                events until it was restarted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wallet backup menu: The "File" menu offers a "Save Copy" option. However now that we now store
                wallet data in a database, just naively copying the wallet file no longer works. There are ways
                to live backup the open wallet database, but we haven't implemented them yet and until we have
                this menu option is disabled.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wallet consistency: It was possible to open the same wallet twice due to unexpected design
                decisions made by the user interface framework we use. This meant that identifying if a wallet
                was active failed because the framework wallet path did not match the one we were using to
                access the wallet file.
            </li>
