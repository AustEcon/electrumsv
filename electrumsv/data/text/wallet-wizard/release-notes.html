        <ul>
            <li>
                Invoices: Fixed a bug where importing an invoice through a BIP270 payment request
                URL failed when it was done using a QR code.
                <a href="https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/495" target="_new">Github issue</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coin-splitting: Added support for a different kind of coin-splitting that does not
                require the use of a faucet. It is recommended over the faucet splitting, and
                should prevent future problems where the faucet being drained or unavailable
                leaves users unable to split their coins.
                <a href="https://dev.azure.com/electrumsv/ElectrumSV/_workitems/edit/97" target="_new">Azure Boards item</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Accounts: The account information dialog would error when displayed for accounts
                that have no keystore. This just affected the watch-only imported address accounts.
                <a href="https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/497" target="_new">Github issue</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Networking: Broadcasting a transaction when there was no current connection or the
                wallet had not realised the connection was down, which would either block
                indefinitely when aborted or when ElectrumSV exited. It should handle an aborted
                or failed transaction broadcast under these circumstances a lot better now.
                <a href="https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/491" target="_new">Github issue</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                User interface: The transaction dialog now colours change outputs correctly again
                rather than colouring them the same as receiving outputs. Transaction outputs
                that are not to addresses are now displayed as scripting "assembly language" again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wallet wizard: Opening certain kinds of invalid wallet files now displays a user
                friendly error message to the wallet operator, rather than catching an exception.
                <a href="https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/478" target="_new">Github issue</a>.
            </li>
