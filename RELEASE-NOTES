ElectrumSV is a fork of the open source Electrum Bitcoin wallet (www.electrum.org) for Bitcoin SV.
The current release is a continuation of the Electron Cash fork from the Electrum 2.9.0 codebase,
continuing on with the goal of supporting the only real Bitcoin.

The ElectrumSV software is NOT affiliated, associated, or endorsed by Electrum, electrum.org or the Electrum
developers.

If you are concerned about running ElectrumSV binaries we recommend installing and/or running it from the github
source directly.


Usage
-----

When you first run ElectrumSV it will use a different configuration directory to Electrum.  On Unix it is
".electrum-sv", and on Windows/MacOS it is "ElectrumSV".  Your wallet files will be copied from the Electrum
cofiguration directory (".electrum" on unix, "Electrum" on Windows/MacOS), if found.  Initially transactions will show
up as unverified because ElectrumSV is downloading the blockchain headers to verify the transactions.  This can take
up to 10 minutes, but is only done once.

Ensure you are running ElectrumSV and not Electrum by checking for "ElectrumSV" in the title bar wording.  Some
users installing from setup.py have reported conflicts if both Electrum and ElectrumSV are installed in parallel
that way.

We STRONGLY recommend you get comfortable and only send a small amount of Bitcoin SV coins at first, to yourself,
to confirm the network is processing your transactions as expected.
